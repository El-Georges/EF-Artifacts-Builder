# Welcome to Endless Frontier Artifacts Builder !

This part is the frontend, it uses simple React framework.

Feel free to report bugs !

Set of commands to make it run

```console
# Get required libraires
npm install

# Start server
npm start
```

It's no more complicated ! :)

If you want to use your personnal database don't forget to change fetch URLs in src/App.js ;)

P.s: the data is located in the data branch!
